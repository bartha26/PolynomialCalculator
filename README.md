# Polynomial Calculator

## Objective
Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for a polynomial calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, and integration operations on polynomials with single-variable and integer coefficients.

## Problem Analysis
The project involves implementing a polynomial calculator with careful consideration for error handling and user-friendliness. Potential challenges include handling scenarios like division by zero and catering to inexperienced users.

## Design
The project follows an object-oriented approach, with a Polynomial class handling operations. JavaFX is used for the frontend, with separate packages for controllers and models. Algorithms are straightforward, with long division being the most complex.

## Implementation
The Polynomial class stores coefficients and exponents using HashMap. Mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, and integration are implemented as methods. Error handling includes checks for division by zero.

## Results
All mathematical operations work correctly, with manual testing uncovering and quickly resolving issues like errors in the division algorithm. JUnit tests ensure the correctness of Polynomial class methods.

## Conclusions
The project provided valuable insights into desktop application development, emphasizing object-oriented design principles and GUI development. Future enhancements could include adding functionality for root finding and improving GUI user-friendliness.

## Bibliography
References include lecture materials, online tutorials, and tools used during the project development.
